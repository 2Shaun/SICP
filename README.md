## Solutions to Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson and Sussman
![wizard](https://g.sicp.me/books/wizard.jpg)

These are my solutions to SICP's exercises. The scm files are organized by chapter. I'm working through this book because the exercises scratch an itch that I didn't know I had. LISP-like syntax at the very least teaches you to think in a different way, but I also believe that the syntax models human thinking closer than any other language I've tried.

What I have learned
* The power of abstraction
* Recursive thinking
* Iterative thinking
* The importance of types
* How to bend and break languages
